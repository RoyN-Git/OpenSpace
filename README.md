# OpenSpace
Have you ever dreamt about exploring deep space? In this project, you'll create a simple web game where you launch
a rocket from an uninhabited planet. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to complete this project: we will start
from the ground up by learning how to implement an HTML skeleton of apage and use CSS. Then, we'll learn how to make
the game interactive with JS, and by the end of the project, you'll have a firm knowledge foundation for developing 
your frontend skills.
